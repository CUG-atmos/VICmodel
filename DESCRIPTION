Description: The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a macroscale
    hydrologic model that solves full water and energy balances, originally
    developed by Xu Liang at the University of Washington (UW). Development
    and maintenance of the current official version of the VIC model at present
    is led by the UW Hydro (Computational Hydrology group) in the Department
    of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UW. VIC is a research model and
    in its various forms it has been applied to most of the major river basins
    around the world, as well as globally. If you make use of this model, please
    acknowledge the appropriate references listed in the help page of this package
    or on the references page <http://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Documentation/
    References/> of the VIC official documentation website. These should include
    Liang et al. (1994) plus any references relevant to the features you are using
    Reference: Liang, X., D. P. Lettenmaier, E. F. Wood, and S. J. Burges (1994),
    A simple hydrologically based model of land surface water and energy fluxes
    for general circulation models, J. Geophys. Res., 99(D7), 14415-14428, <doi:
    10.1029/94JD00483>.
