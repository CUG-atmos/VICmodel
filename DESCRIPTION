Description: This is an R implementation of the UW Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) 
    model (Liang et al., 1994). VIC is a macroscale hydrologic model that solves full 
    water and energy balances, originally developed by Xu Liang at the University of 
    Washington (UW). 
    Development and maintenance of the current official version of the VIC model at 
    present is led by the UW Hydro | Computational Hydrology group in the Department 
    of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. 
    VIC is a research model and in its various forms it has been applied to most of 
    the major river basins around the world, as well as globally. If you make use of 
    this model, please acknowledge the appropriate references listed in the help page 
    of this package or on the references page 
    (http://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Documentation/References/) 
    of the VIC official documentation website. These should include Liang et al., 1994 
    plus any references relevant to the features you are using, which are cited in 
    the feature descriptions on the Model Overview page.
